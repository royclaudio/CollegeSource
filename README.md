APP Description:
MY App is intended for currently enrolled students able to run an Audit Page For themselves Via UNM COLLEGESOURCE APP, To help the students keep track of their progress by simply opening the app, while feeling encouraged and reminded on a daily basis that they can in fact make their parents proud and graduate with any college degree they want. 
My app reads the HTML version of the audit page and digests the info into a simple UI for the user to understand. With the progress of their degree to be the front-line widget, while their current weighted UNM GPA to be the second. The idea of this app is to give the user the ability to quickly showcase their UNM degree to any Viewers, I.E job interviewers, internship interviews etc. if won I win the UNM APP contest I will expand this idea to help current freshman understand what classes they will need to take in the future. At the moment it just highlights the studentsâ€™ current position in their degree, with a total GPA, per semester GPA and total percentage to completion based on current credit hours, as of being enrolled.

constraints, due too the time constraint this app can only access UNM student info based on per login basis 

I, Roy Claudio was the sole creator of this Application, I am a College junior in Computer Science, I love applying my knowledge to solve Problems and enjoyed the process of creating this app. 

Due to limited funds I was not able to create a firebase login system per user, to store their info per login.
